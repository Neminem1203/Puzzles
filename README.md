# Puzzles
Doing a bunch of different puzzles from different sources. These are all the puzzles I have done on my spare time. Most of them are from the Daily Programmer challenge. Some of them were found on reddit. If you find any issues with my solutions, please feel free to message me.
If you would like to try the puzzles before looking at the solution, I usually post the question above the solution for context.
